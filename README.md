# Oil_Spills_Overtime_Analysis
Team Yellow: Aaron Scheet, Amy Velasquez, Natalee Turner, Rachel McKinnon, Jeffrey Sykora

## Topic: Oil Spills Overtime
- What is the main cause of oil spills?
- Where do most oil spills occur?
- How does weather effect an oil spill?
- How many oils spills were caused by accidents such as construction? And how can they be prevented going forward?
- Is it possible to predict possible future oil spills?

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- Stats Model Library
- Plotly
- SQL
- JavaScript
- HTML
- GLM
- Linear Regression Modeling

## Deliverables:
- 1. Clean Hazardous Liquid Accident Datasets from the Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration section on the U.S. Department of Transportation website.
- 2. After cleaning, join old data sets (Pre 1986 through 2002) and new data sets (2002-Present) in SQL.
- 3. After joining tables, parse through them to provide smaller tables of information regarding question topics.
- 4. Export table dataframes into python and create Plotly graphs and maps.
- 5. Maps should show locations of oil spills from 2002-Present with the severity of each oil spill having a larger circle on the map, graphs and tables can provide information on Pre 2002 Oil Spills.
- 6. Can create a heatmap for certain locations (either by Country/State) to show severity of oil spills over a period of time.
- 7. Use linear regression and glm as machine learning techniques to provide information on the relationship of an oil spill occuring dependent on pipe corrosion/outside pressure on the pipe.
- 8. Create interactive webpage using javascript and html.
- 9. Put together presentation to present to the class.
