# Oil_Spills_Overtime_Analysis
Team Yellow: Aaron Scheet, Amy Velasquez, Natalee Turner, Rachel McKinnon, Jeffrey Sykora

## Topic: Oil Spills Overtime
- What are the major contributing factors that cause an incident to occur?
- Where do most oil spills occur?
- What percentage of total incidents were due to weather? How does weather effect the severity of an oil spill? 
- How many oils spills were caused by accidents such as construction? And how can they be prevented going forward?

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- Stats Model Library
- MatplotLib
- R
- JavaScript
- Plotly
- HTML
- GLM
- Linear Regression Modeling
- Excel

## Deliverables:
- 1. Clean Hazardous Liquid Accident Datasets from the Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration section on the U.S. Department of Transportation website.
- 2. Create an outline of parts of tables that we will join together for further analysis.
- 3. Join information from tables regarding question topics.
- 4. Export table dataframes into python and create Plotly graphs and maps.
- 5. Maps should show locations of oil spills from 2002-Present with the severity of each oil spill having a larger circle on the map, graphs and tables can provide information on Pre 2002 Oil Spills.
- 6. Can create a heatmap for certain locations (State) to show severity of oil spills over a period of time.
- 7. Describe statistics, identify most important factors. 
- 8. Use logistic regression and glm as machine learning techniques to provide information on the relationship of an oil spill occuring dependent on pipe corrosion & age of the pipe.
- 9. Create interactive webpage using javascript and html. 3 tabs: Map(Severity of Oil Spill), Model(dashboard), Description and Stats.
- 10. Put together presentation to present to the class.
