## Summary
With the millions of miles of pipelines across the US moving liquid or gas products from fields between different entities on and offshore, 
pipelines are effective and mostly safe. Even so, pipeline spills or leaks do happen. These incidents are tracked by PHMSA (Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration) and kept in a database. For this site, we used exploratory analysis methods on multiple sources to map pipeline incidents, 
look at incidents over time, document interesting stats and identify a cause of commonality using unsupervised machine learning.

## Topic: Oil Spills Overtime
- What are the major contributing factors that cause an incident to occur?
- Where do most oil spills occur?
- What percentage of total incidents were due to weather? How does weather effect the severity of an oil spill? 
- How many oils spills were caused by accidents such as construction? And how can they be prevented going forward?
- Machine Learning Model: Unsupervised Learning; how does the age of the pipeline, the internal pressure of the pipeline and the cause of the incident show any relationships to each other.
